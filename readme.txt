Adds an attached files list to the end of posts and pages

== Description ==
Adds a list of any attached files to the end of posts and pages.

Attached files are displayed with a link so that they can be easily downloaded,
along with a 16x16 icon identifying the type of file and file size.

Thanks to [Mark James](http://www.famfamfam.com/) for the outstanding silk
icon set, and for licensing it under the CC license.

== Installation ==
Copy the folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ folder where you installed WordPress
and activate the plugin. The attached files section will display on posts as
soon as the plugin is activated.

= Options =
There is a single option added to the Writing settings page, and it is whether
rAttach displays the attached files by default.

If you typically will not want to display attachments, but may occasionally, you
will want to clear the checkbox and click save.  If you want attachments displayed
on most or all posts the checkbox should stay checked.

Either way, you can override the option.  Adding a custom field named rAttach-on
with a value of anything other than empty or a zero will display attachments
regardless of the option setting.  Likewise, rAttach-off with any non-blank, non-zero
value will force the page to not display attached files.
